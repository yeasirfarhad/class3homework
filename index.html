	<p class="content1"> Start Fast with These Demo Content Generators</p>

	<p id="content1">Demo content is probably one of the least talked about items in a designer’s toolbox. Yet, it’s also very useful. While we often see it as a means to populate a mockup or show what a CMS theme is capable of, there are other good uses. For instance, it can serve as a placeholder during site development – you know, while you wait for the “real” stuff to arrive. This helps you continue to move forward on a project that could otherwise be stalled. Likewise, demo content can live up to its name by helping you demonstrate various processes. Things like training videos or documentation can use bits and pieces to show users how a certain feature works. Overall, it’s something that can be quite handy to have around. And there are a number of resources out there to fill your specific needs. Below is a selection some of the coolest demo content generators on the web. Enjoy!</p>
